Background:
A group of terrorists have found out that blowing up 
a cargo ship will create political disturbance
and bring the economy in offshore industry out of 
balance. Thus the terrorists want to blow up this 
cargo ship. 

However, the rumour about this attack has reached 
the Government Intelligence and counter-terrorists
have been sent to the ship to prevent it from being
blown up.

Counter-Terrorists: 
Terrorists are on this ship. They want to blow it
up, and they will kill to do so. Prevent them from
doing that at all costs.

Terrorists:
Find the marked spots of the ship and plant the c4
explosives. You may find counter-terrorist trying 
to prevent you in fullfilling our evil plan. In that
case do not think, just kill the bastards.
